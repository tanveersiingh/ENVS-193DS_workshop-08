## General information

This dataset is from: Valliere, Justin; Zhang, Jacqueline; Sharifi, M.; Rundel, Philip (2019). Data from: Can we condition native plants to increase drought tolerance and improve restoration success? [Dataset]. Dryad. [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v0861f7](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v0861f7)  

The published paper is: Valliere J. M., J. Zhang, M. R. Sharifi, and P. W. Rundel. 2019. Can we condition native plants to increase drought tolerance and improve restoration success? Ecological Applications 29(3):e01863. [10.1002/eap.1863](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1863).

This repository is for demonstrating fitting models with categorical and continuous predictors and model selection.

```

All code is in the `code` folder. The code runs models, generates model predictions, and visualizes data.

## Rendered output

The rendered key is [here](https://an-bui.github.io/ENVS-193DS_workshop-08/code/workshop-08_code_KEY.html).  

You will need to find the rendered output to your own .html in your forked version of the repository! Insert that link here.
